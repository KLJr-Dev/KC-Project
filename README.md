# KC-Project

KC-Project is a long-term software engineering and web security project focused on
designing, deploying, exploiting, and securing a modern web application.

The project intentionally follows an insecure-by-design → penetration testing →
security hardening lifecycle in order to explore the full Software Development
Lifecycle (SDLC) and modern DevSecOps practices.

## Current Status

This repository is currently in the **research and design phase**.

No application code has been implemented yet.  
All early work is focused on:
- defining project scope
- researching modern web application stacks
- documenting architectural and engineering decisions

## Repository Structure

KC-Project/
├── README.md # Project overview
└── docs/ # Engineering and project documentation
    └── README.md

## Documentation

All technical and engineering notes are maintained in the `/docs` directory.
These documents are expected to evolve as the project progresses from design
into implementation.

## Collaboration

This project is developed collaboratively and uses Git for version control.
Branching strategy, contribution guidelines, and CI/CD workflows will be defined
once the implementation phase begins.

More details will be added as the project evolves.
