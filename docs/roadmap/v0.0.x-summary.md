# v0.0.x Foundation Phase — Summary

This document captures the state of KC-Project at the end of the **v0.0.x foundation phase** (v0.0.1 through v0.0.8).

---

## What Was Built

The foundation phase established the project's shape, contracts, and tooling without introducing any real behaviour or persistence.

### System shape

- **Backend** (NestJS 11) — five domain modules (users, auth, files, sharing, admin) with controllers, services, and DTOs. All data is mock/in-memory. Runs on port 4000.
- **Frontend** (Next.js 16, App Router) — client-side pages exercising every backend route. Typed API client with auto-generated types. Runs on port 3000.
- **Communication** — plain HTTP REST over JSON. No WebSockets, GraphQL, or tRPC.
- **Persistence** — none. All data resets on process restart.

### Contracts

- Backend API shape frozen at v0.0.6 — route paths, HTTP methods, and DTO structures defined for all five domains.
- Frontend integrated at v0.0.7 — every backend route is called from a corresponding UI page.
- Types auto-generated from OpenAPI spec at v0.0.8 — single source of truth flows from backend DTOs to frontend interfaces.

### Tooling

- **TypeScript** `strict: true` on both frontend and backend
- **Prettier** shared config at repo root, enforced on both projects
- **ESLint** configured per-project with Prettier integration
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** auto-generated from backend DTOs via `@nestjs/swagger` CLI plugin
- **openapi-typescript** generates frontend types from the OpenAPI spec

## Version-by-Version Recap

| Version | Milestone |
|---------|-----------|
| v0.0.1 | Repository skeleton — README, `/docs` directory |
| v0.0.2 | Roadmap and scope definition, security philosophy documented |
| v0.0.3 | Backend bootstrapped (NestJS scaffold, module structure) |
| v0.0.4 | Frontend bootstrapped (Next.js App Router, static pages) |
| v0.0.5 | Backend reachability test (`/ping` endpoint, frontend fetch) |
| v0.0.6 | Backend API shape defined (5 domains, DTOs, mock services) |
| v0.0.7 | Frontend-backend contract integration (typed API client, domain pages) |
| v0.0.8 | Development tooling baseline (strict TS, Prettier, OpenAPI codegen) |

## Key Decisions Made

All recorded as Architecture Decision Records in [`/docs/decisions/`](../decisions/):

- **ADR-001** — NestJS as backend framework (over FastAPI, Express)
- **ADR-002** — Next.js App Router as frontend framework (over plain React/Vite)
- **ADR-003** — REST over tRPC for API communication
- **ADR-004** — Manual DTO mirroring first, then OpenAPI codegen
- **ADR-005** — TypeScript strict mode on both projects
- **ADR-006** — Insecure-by-design philosophy
- **ADR-007** — Five-domain module split (users, auth, files, sharing, admin)

---

## What Is Not Present

The following are explicitly absent at the end of v0.0.x. Each will be introduced per the roadmap:

- **Database / persistence** — all data is in-memory (v0.2.x)
- **Authentication enforcement** — no passwords checked, no sessions, no tokens (v0.1.x)
- **Authorization / RBAC** — no role checks, no access control (v0.4.x)
- **Input validation** — DTOs define shape but nothing is enforced (v0.1.x+)
- **Real file I/O** — file module stores metadata only (v0.3.x)
- **Containers / deployment** — local dev only (v0.5.x)
- **CI/CD** — no pipelines, no automated testing

---

## Transition to v0.1.x

The v0.1.x phase introduces the **identity and authentication surface**:

- v0.1.0 defines a proper `User` entity (beyond the current DTO-only model)
- v0.1.1–v0.1.2 add registration and login with intentionally weak security
- v0.1.3–v0.1.5 introduce sessions/tokens and authentication edge cases

The foundation phase guarantees that the system shape, contracts, and tooling are stable. From v0.1.0 onward, the focus shifts from structure to **behaviour**.
