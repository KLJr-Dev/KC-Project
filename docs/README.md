# Documentation

This directory contains engineering and technical documentation for the KC-Project project.

At this stage, documentation is focused on:
- architectural considerations
- technology stack evaluation
- deployment models
- versioning and lifecycle planning

These documents are living artifacts and will evolve alongside the project as it
moves from research and design into implementation, testing, and deployment.
