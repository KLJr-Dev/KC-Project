# Infrastructure

This directory will contain deployment and infrastructure definitions for **KC-Project**.

---

## Current Status

**Unused.** Infrastructure is not introduced until **v0.5.x** (Containerisation & Deployment Surface) per the [roadmap](../docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md).

---

## Planned Contents (v0.5.x+)

- `Dockerfile` for frontend
- `Dockerfile` for backend
- `docker-compose.yml` for local multi-container orchestration
- Environment variable templates (`.env.example`)
- Database initialisation scripts
- VM deployment notes (v0.6.x)

---

## Why This Directory Exists Now

The directory was created during the repository skeleton phase (v0.0.1) to establish the project's top-level structure. Having the placeholder ensures the intended layout is visible from the start, even though no infrastructure code exists yet.
