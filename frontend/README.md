# Frontend

This directory contains the frontend application for **KC-Project**.

The frontend is implemented using **Next.js (App Router)** and provides
the user-facing interface for interacting with the backend API. Like
the backend, it is developed incrementally and intentionally lacks
strong security guarantees in early versions.

---

## Current Status

**Version:** v0.0.8 (Foundation Phase)

- Next.js application scaffolded (App Router, Tailwind CSS)
- Client-side types **auto-generated from OpenAPI spec** (`lib/types.gen.ts`)
- Re-export layer with friendly aliases (`lib/types.ts`)
- Typed API client covers every backend route (`lib/api.ts`)
- Pages exercise full CRUD for all five backend domains
- Backend connectivity verified via `/ping`
- ESLint configured with Prettier integration
- Shared Prettier config (root-level `.prettierrc`)
- No authentication enforcement
- No form validation
- No token storage or session handling

---

## Purpose

The frontend is considered an **untrusted client** at all stages of
the project. All security enforcement is expected to occur server-side.

The frontend will eventually be responsible for:
- User authentication flows
- Role-based UI rendering
- File management interactions
- Administrative interfaces
- Client-side navigation and state handling

---

## Running the Frontend (Local Development)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
The backend must be running on `http://localhost:4000` for API calls to succeed.

## API Client (`lib/api.ts`)

A single API client module wraps every backend route with typed fetch calls.

- Base URL: `http://localhost:4000`
- All functions return typed promises using interfaces from `lib/types.ts`
- Errors are **not** swallowed — they propagate so pages can display them inline
- No authentication headers are sent (v0.0.7 scope)

---

## Type Generation

Frontend types are auto-generated from the backend's OpenAPI spec:

```bash
# Backend must be running on :4000
npm run generate:types
```

This downloads the spec to `openapi.json` and generates `lib/types.gen.ts`.
The `lib/types.ts` file re-exports schemas with friendly aliases so all
existing imports remain stable.
